There are differences, you can tell things do just run smoother, and the screen itself is sharper.  The main feature changes I am really torn on.  So the fingerprint reader is under the screen, it is great to see that technology in use.  The problem I would say is not its function, I would say it works well 90% of the time.  The time it doesn't work is probably more on me than the phone.  So in previous generations, you knew all the time exactly where the reader was.  If the screen is off there is no indication of where the reader is.  So then if you tap the screen to turn it on there is a delay that just feels on the long side, granted it's not that long just feels long when compared to other features, and long when you can press the button on the side and get almost instant gratification.
