If you dive into some of the current GCP Architect training (2020/09) there are several answers where the right answer was an open-source solution running on GCP.\"), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"div\", null, \"Next up is AWS.  I would say like GCP they are more global first, but still lacking when compared to GCP.  Their Virtual Private Networks, also span regions.

When compared to GCP or even Azure, and you could have an easier time migrating legacy software to their system because of their offerings.  I would make some of the same callouts around their features like cloud storage lifecycle management, network tagging, AI Services (Rekognition, SageMaker,  etc), Athena, and Aurora.  To see a full list of AWS products you can go, \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://aws.amazon.com/products/\",\n    target: \"_blank\",\n    title: \"AWS Products\",\n    \"aria-label\": \"AWS Products\"\n  }, \"AWS Products\"), \".\"), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"div\", null, \"Not diving into specifics as much as it was on GCP is not implying AWS is less, but the services do not need the call out.  AWS is probably the most complete cloud offering at the moment.  If you want to use containers they have an offering, if you want MySQL or NoSQL, AWS supports MySQL and has both DynonoDB and MongoDB. One of the biggest features I would complain about with AWS is its web site.  If you have 5 servers in 5 different regions if you watch the URL, each server is managed by a system in that region.  So even though AWS talked about being global their site almost gives off a different feel.\"), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"div\", null, \"Last but not least is Azure.  If you are running MS SQL Server, applications created with .NET, VMWare servers, Microsoft Active Directory, or other Microsoft Services, moving to Azure can be the simplest, and most natural choice.  Azure does not have as many services/products as AWS, but I would estimate it probably has at least 150, and so most products you can find a direct one to one replacement.  Some of the things I would call out on Azure is IoT, Service Fabric, Azure SQL Server, AI Services (cognitive services), and  CosmosDB.

Azure also has Azure Stack, which brings Azure Environment to your data center.  This can have some major benefits.   Let's say you have regulatory requirements that certain data cannot leave your data center, this can help meet that requirement, or if you are a manufacturing plant this could bring some of their AI cognitive services to your data center to connect your cameras to help monitor your goods for product defects in real-time.
