I would highly recommend it, but when when they did this, it was not a new concept back in 2008.

That is over 15 years ago. Those are just the articles I remember about, I am sure we can probably go back a little further. Then lets jump ahead to what is out there currently, that directly connects to the brain. What is out there currently is more advacive, and not as easy to concel.

This new version is small enough that no one would know you have one installed. It can be flush with the skull and is approximatly 23mm x 8mm. The threads that connect to the brain are flexible and has over 1000 channels per link. It contains other sensrs like temperature, pressure, 6-axis IMU, etc, and potentially has all day battery life. If you have not watched the demo I highly recommend to pause reading this and watch at least the first 30 minutes so you can see the demo around the pig. They have one pig that they connected two devices to, and in one demo you could see how they are able to read the data that was being sent to determin where the pigs joints/limbs would be. That might not seem like much, but pause for a moment to think about what that means. They have collected, and analyized enough data to read the electrical impulses of the brain to know those actions. It looks like this can also write data to the brain, or at least send a signal that is processed and triggers an action. This is what the conversation shifts to what could be.\"), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"div\", null, \"There are several paths that could be taken around this technology, both benifitial and harmful. Lets get through the bad stuff first. For some reason people like to just focus on that. If there is a device that can write signals to the brain and they can be processed, in theory you can control that person, everything. Which is scary, but not the worst part. In theory could implant memories or thoughts. What would happen if someone could implant that a random stranger just attacked someone in your family and possibly killed them? It would be possible to concieve a reality where you attacked them and did them harm before you were stopped. Other possiblities could be causing issues with your senses, like seeing or hearing something that is not there, feeling like your on fire or freezing, or other horiffic possibilities. It could also be possible that maybe they are able to send a signal that blocks other signals. What would happen if they could send a signal that causes your heart to stop beating, or you to think you are breathing but your not. Who would need biochemical warfare? This would be the next level of cyber warfare where you can take out anyone in the world with a couple keystrokes. I am sure there are others that could happen but lets shift and focus on what this could mean.\"), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"div\", null, \"Lets start with some things Mr. Musk is already touting.

If you think about it are not that far of a stretch concidering what I just mentioned about harmful uses. The same way someone could write information to the brain to make you think you see, hear, or touch something that is not there, you could have it connected to a device that wrote the information that was there so the person could process. The device is mentioned about connecting it to an app on a phone via bluetooth. Now imaging being able to take the camera on that phone and have it send the data to the device which writes it directly to your brain. So if you were born with eyes that had an issue your phone could be used so you could actually see. The mic could be used so you could actually hear. Recently a VR company has replicated touch. If they can replicate touch, why couldn't that data be sent directly to the brain, \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://campustechnology.com/articles/2020/05/01/vr-device-replicates-touch.aspx#:~:text=A%20new%20virtual%20reality%20device,simulate%20the%20sensation%20of%20solidity.\",\n    target: \"_blank\",\n    title: \"VR Device Replicates Touch\",\n    \"aria-label\": \"VR Device Replicates Touch\"\n  }, \"VR Device Replicates Touch\"), \". \", mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"br\", null), \"Switching slightly, lets look at surgery.

What if this could help humans be more efficiant. For example if you compare human's eyeshight to that of most animals our sight is horrible, the same can probably be said about most of the senses, along with things like breathing. If you compare our breathing to that of a bird, we are very iniffecient. Lets start with the breathing. If you think about how humans breath, it is a simple in and out motion. It really isn't all that effective. As you breath out air that has already been consumed mixes with the new air you are breathing. Not the best option. Birds on the other had avoid the mixing problem. They move air through their lugs in one direction. So for every one bird breath humans have to take two. What if there was a electronic signal that could make it so when you breathed in air from one lungh went to the other and then the new air went into the now empty lung so new and old air never was in the same tube at the same time.
