However, let\\u2019s be honest,  you probably haven\\u2019t fully made it to the cloud.  You have probably started to be cloud-first, and that you have a plan in motion to finish migrating everything.  If it's a small migration you can complete it within three to 6 months.  So if you started in February 2020 you might just be finishing in August 2020, but more than likely you still have at least 6 months left.

If you look up the definition of cloud computing it basically is just saying you are using a network of remote computers hosted on the internet.  With it being a buzzword everyone is trying to do it.  It partially reminds me of Web 2.0.  It was mostly a marketing term.  It was used to define a bunch of functionality that wasn\\u2019t new, and anything but magic.  It had a focus on user interaction and started to make things more visually appealing.  You could probably argue it was the start of the modern human-centered design.  The term cloud covers a large set of services that fall into one of several categories: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service), and PaaS (Platform as a Service).  There are others but typically they still fall in one of the three core categories like DBaaS (Database as a Service) and FaaS (Functions as a Service).

A cloud architect is anything but a buzzword.  The cloud architect\\u2019s job is to convert the requirements (both tech and business) and create an architecture to meet the needs.  Each of the big three providers has well over 100 different resources each.  The job is to be an expert generalist.  You can never be an expert in everything in the cloud.  The cloud architect has to have an idea of what resources to use and the layout to use.  They might not know 100% the final build until it's done, but like planning a family road trip they have to know where to start, the destination, and the general route that will be used to get there.  They also have to plan out that you will probably deviate a few places to sightsee and they will have to adjust, but they have a vision of the route to take.  You can argue, probably any good architect would fall into this, they are a focused CTO/CIO.
