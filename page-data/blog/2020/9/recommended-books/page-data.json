Before we dive into why the book is important, we need to understand what digital transformation is.  Digital transformation is a bit unique to your business, as its how your business can best adapt digital technology not just to interact with your consumers, internally as well to improve or replace processes but also automate and update processes.  The company I work for back in 2018 goes into more detail about what Digital Transformation is and the article can be found here, <a href=\"https://www.nerdery.com/insights/digital-transformations-so-what-moment/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Digital Transformation's &quot;So What?&quot;\" aria-label=\"Digital Transformation's &quot;So What?&quot;\">Digital Transformation's &quot;So What?&quot;</a>. \n  </div>\n  <br/><br/>\n  <div>\n    There is a meme/image traveling the internet that asks who lead the digital transformation for the company.

As Covid-19 pushed people to socially distance, work remotely, shop online more, and just spend more time at home and online, companies had to adapt. How do companies adapt, look at how they can do a digital transformation. The goal of this book is to help you on your way to becoming a digital master. This skill is currently a very important one as everyone is trying to find their path through this new digital frontier.  <br/>\nThe book might be from 2014, and there is a rumor that a complimentary book will be coming out next year, but it still is highly recommended about helping you prepare for leading the digital transformation.\n  </div>\n  <br/><br/>\n  <div>\n    <H3 title=\"Strengths Finder 2.0 and Emotional Intelligence 2.0\">Strengths Finder 2.0 and Emotional Intelligence 2.0</H3>\n    These books both have an assessment you can take and then complement the assessment to help you improve.
