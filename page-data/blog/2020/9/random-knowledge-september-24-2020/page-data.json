After that Microsoft altered its conference schedule and introduce Microsoft Ignite in 2015.  Just to have some fun the first TechEd videos I could find are for 2007. I can find something about a Klingon at the 2004 TechEd, however, it is short and I do not have context but show some classic .NET winforms, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulYEdo5agDI\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Klingon at the 2004 TechEd\" aria-label=\"Klingon at the 2004 TechEd\">Klingon at the 2004 TechEd</a>.\r\n  </div>\r\n  <br/><br/>\r\n  <div>\r\n    Just reflecting how far we have come.
