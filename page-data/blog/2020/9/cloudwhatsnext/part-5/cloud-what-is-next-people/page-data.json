There is a good chance you will have replaced most or all of your team by the time you finish.  Do you ask your employees why they are leaving?  I would bet it probably falls into one of a couple of categories:  lack of growth, competition, and company culture.  You cannot do much about the competition.  People will always think the grass is greener, or that the 10 - 20% or more is hard to pass up.  They are right, it can be especially early in their career.  However, as people go on they realize that culture and growth is more important.  With a good culture and growth, some of those people who leave will probably try to find a way back.  During the hiring process, you can look to hire people who match the culture the company wants to inspire.  I would say growth can be the hardest part.  Growth isn’t just advancement in the company, however, typically that is the goal.  What are you doing to help encourage your employees to grow their skill set, to grow professionally?
