That is the concept that she brings. You didn't fail, you don't know it yet. Which is very powerful with the right mindset. There is a lot of negative things you could say about this for reasons it won't work for you. Let's just play in a vacuum and think about for a moment what would that mean for you.\n  </div>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n  <div>\n  Please pause for a moment and reflect on that.\n  </div>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n  <div>\n  Now before you say that's great but not possible, what steps would it take to make some, not all, but at least some a reality.
