There is a concept of Agile DevOps.  Agile is focused on getting smaller teams to collaborate, and DevOps is about bringing together two large siloed teams.  The goal of combining Development (Dev) and IT Operations (Ops) is so they can share knowledge and responsibility, about 30%.  That allows each team to do what they do best, but also help the other team with the overlap.  The Ops part of DevOps might not be as used to having to script everything out and write code, which having the Dev as part of the team really can help.  The Dev part is not going to be as familiar with what and why to be deploying certain infrastructure, that the Dev team should now be responsible for.
