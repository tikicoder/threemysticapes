The primary reason is the name itself. Your goal is to be more agile with the development process. The emphasis on short iterative planning and development cycles encourages testing sooner with incremental updates.  This allows you to identify issues sooner and get them fixed sooner.  The sooner you identify an issue the less likely it becomes more embed and can be fixed, which saves money. The short iterative also encourages evaluating where you are and where you need to go.\r\n  </div>\r\n  <br/><br/>\r\n  <div>\r\n    This goes well with DevOps and the concept of everything as Code. There is a concept of Agile DevOps.  Agile is focused on getting smaller teams to collaborate, and DevOps is about bringing together two large siloed teams.  The goal of combining Development (Dev) and IT Operations (Ops) is so they can share knowledge and responsibility, about 30%.  That allows each team to do what they do best, but also help the other team with the overlap.  The Ops part of DevOps might not be as used to having to script everything out and write code, which having the Dev as part of the team really can help.  The Dev part is not going to be as familiar with what and why to be deploying certain infrastructure, that the Dev team should now be responsible for. In a true DevOps focus, the goal is to be releasing new releases potentially several times per day, Agile uses sprints.

With the smaller team sizes, you can help to ensure that the entire team can contribute to the ideas, which is important to ensuring that everyone can be heard.
